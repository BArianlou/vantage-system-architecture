# Project Vantage: Quantitative Predictive Engine
### Stochastic Physics-Integrated Predictive Analysis (SPIPA)

**Architect:** Bijan Arianlou
**Status:** Operational // Private R&D

---

## Executive Summary
Vantage is a generalizable predictive framework built on **Stochastic Physics-Integrated Predictive Analysis (SPIPA)**. Unlike traditional statistical fitting, SPIPA models competitive systems as dynamic physical environments characterized by quantifiable energy states, transition potentials, and entropy.

## System Architecture
The system operates on the **Triune Architecture**:
1.  **Apex (Ingestion):** Pulls granular telemetry to build physics-aligned statistical profiles.
2.  **Chronos (Simulation):** Executes 10,000 vectorized Monte Carlo simulations to map the probability distribution of outcomes.
3.  **Vantage (Scanner):** Compares the model's probabilistic output against market consensus to detect structural alpha.

### Core Capabilities
*   **Physics-Based Modeling:** Maps EPA (Expected Points Added) to Potential Energy and Turnovers to Entropy.
*   **Vectorized Simulation:** NumPy-based kernels executing 10,000 runs per event.
*   **Alpha Detection:** Identifies structural divergences >3.0 points against institutional baselines.

### Validation Case: NFL 2025-2026
*   **Calibration:** Converged to within 3.2 points of market consensus.
*   **Edge Identification:** Correctly identified directional bias in high-variance Total Score markets (15+ point divergence).
